## Contactless Heart-Rate Measurement


### About
This project was done as a part of Digital Image Processing Course

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block


- Heart-Rate of a person is measured without physically coming in contact with any device
- It uses Camera to record a 2-3 second clip of the person
- The recorded clip is amplified to observe subtle changes in the skin color
- The subtle color changes when seen as frequency gives heart rate of the person
- This follows the concept of Eulerian Video Magnification
- Accuracy compared to an optical sensor was 93.12 %
